# My first GitHub Project

This is the first project created using Cloud9 IDE and pushed to remote repository using git and GitHub.

## Technologies Used

In this project we used HTML5 and CSS3 to create 3 webpages that utlises a nav bar at the top of each page to navigate between each page.

We learned that you must have a file names index.html as the default homepage.

We renamed file from stream-one.html to index.html within Cloud9 IDE and pushed the changes to GitHub using basic git commands.
